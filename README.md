Menu:
used as an executable file when testing other projects
instead of pinning and unpinning projects to task bar
i pin this and choose the program i'm testing from the menu
this way i can edit projects, build them, and then easily run them without errors (assuming the code in the project itself is correct)

KarutaJobBoard:
this is a scripting bot i made because i am lazy
and didn't want to type the 10 commands needed for optimization

resinCalculator:
currently using this to keep track of my progress/give me an estimation of
how much time left i have for a game project

TimeCalculator:
takes the user's current time, takes the time to be added, tells you what time it will be
can also be used to figure out how many days hours minutes seconds are in a given amount of days hours minutes seconds if initial time is set to 0 0 0
mostly did this so i could remember how to use classes, friend, and operator overloading
