Menu:
used as an executable file when testing other projects
instead of pinning and unpinning projects to task bar
i pin this and choose the program i'm testing from the menu
this way i can edit projects, build them, and then easily run them without errors (assuming the code in the project itself is correct)

KarutaJobBoard:
this is a scripting bot i made because i am lazy
and didn't want to type the 10 commands needed for optimization

resinCalculator:
currently using this to keep track of my progress/give me an estimation of
how much time left i have for a given project
